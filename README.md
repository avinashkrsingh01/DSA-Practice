DSA Practice Repository
Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Practice Repository! This repository contains solutions to a variety of DSA problems that I practice regularly to sharpen my coding skills. The problems cover a range of core topics in data structures and algorithms, including trees, sorting, object-oriented programming, recursion, sliding window techniques, two-pointer approaches, and many more.

About
The goal of this repository is to build a comprehensive collection of solutions to DSA problems, providing reference solutions and explaining common techniques. By working on these problems, I aim to enhance my problem-solving skills and gain a deeper understanding of key algorithms and data structures.

Topics Covered
This repository includes solutions for the following topics:

Tree Algorithms: Binary trees, binary search trees, traversal techniques (in-order, pre-order, post-order), etc.
Sorting: Implementations of various sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, bubblesort, and others.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Concepts and problem-solving using OOP principles.
Recursion: Recursive solutions and common recursion patterns.
Sliding Window: Techniques for solving problems involving dynamic subarrays and sequences.
Two Pointer: Solutions using two-pointer techniques for efficient array and string manipulation.
Others: Various other algorithmic and problem-solving techniques that come up in competitive programming and coding interviews.
Folder Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
